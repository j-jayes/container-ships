How big are container ships? {.storyboard}
==================================================================================

### They're pretty big! This image is from [The Geography of Transport Systems](https://transportgeography.org/contents/chapter5/maritime-transportation/evolution-containerships-classes/) and shows how container ships have become pretty large! 

```{r, fig.width = 10}

```


***
The latest generation of Ultra Large Container Ships (ULCS) can carry more than 15,000 TEUs, or twenty-foot equivalent units, the measure that shipping companies use to compare volume. The Ever Given has a capacity of 20,124 TEU. That's

### The median ship has gotten longer and wider over time. This plot shows the size of the average cargo ship by decade.

```{r, fig.width = 12}

df %>% 
  mutate(decade = launched - launched %% 10) %>% 
  group_by(decade) %>% 
  summarise(mean_length = mean(length, na.rm = T),
            mean_beam = mean(beam, na.rm = T),
            mean_tonnage = mean(tonnage, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  filter(!decade %in% c(NA, 1760),
         decade > 1860) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fill = mean_tonnage, 
             xmin = 0, xmax = mean_length,
             ymin = 0, ymax = mean_beam)) +
  geom_rect() +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  facet_wrap(~ decade) +
  labs(x = "Length of average ship",
       y = "Beam of average ship (width at widest point)",
       fill = "Deadweight tonnage of average ship") +
  theme(legend.position = "right", legend.key.height = unit(2.5, "cm")) +
  guides(fill = guide_colourbar(title.position = "top"))

```

The Ever Given is 400m long and 58m wide at her widest point. This is the equivalent area of nearly 4 football fields! And to think, she has only 25 crew on her!

### The increase in size has been in length, beam (width at widest point), and deadweight tonnage. Have a look at how the rate of increase in deadweight tonnage has picked up since 2000.

```{r}

df_facet <- df %>% 
  filter(launched > 1970) %>%
  pivot_longer(c("tonnage", "length", "beam"),
               names_to = "feature", values_to = "value") %>% 
  mutate(feature = str_to_title(feature)) %>% 
  mutate(feature = factor(feature, 
                          levels = c("Length", "Beam", "Tonnage"))) %>% 
  mutate(flag_eg = if_else(name == "Ever Given", 1, 0))

renderPlotly({
  
 g <- df_facet %>%   
  filter(feature %in% input$feature) %>%
  ggplot(aes(launched, value, colour = launched, group = 1)) +
  geom_smooth(se = T, colour = "grey50") +
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_point(data = df_facet %>% filter(flag_eg == 1,
                                        feature %in% input$feature),
             aes(shape = name),
             cex = 10,
             show.legend = T,
             colour = "midnightblue") +
  geom_text(data = df_facet %>% filter(flag_eg == 1,
                                       feature %in% input$feature),
            aes(label = name), show.legend = F, colour = "grey25", size = 6) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = 18) +
  scale_x_continuous(guide = guide_axis(check.overlap = T)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::number_format()) +
  scale_color_viridis_c() +
  facet_grid(feature ~ ., scales = "free") +
  labs(x = "Year launched",
       y = "Value",
       colour = "Year launched",
       shape = "Highlight") +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, NA)) 
  # theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.key.height = unit(1.5, "cm")) +
  # guides(fill = guide_colourbar(title.position = "right"))
 
  ggplotly(g)

})
```

**Select the metric you want to look at over time:**

```{r}

metrics <- c("Length", "Beam", "Tonnage") %>% as_tibble()

selectizeInput("feature", label = "Chosen metric:",
            choices = unique(metrics$value), 
            selected = "Tonnage",
            multiple = T)

```

Wow! That's a steep increase in the amount of stuff these cargo ships can carry! The Ever Given, highlighted here with a midnight blue diamond is among the largest cargo ships today. Launched in 2018, she has a deadweight tonnage capacity of nearly 220,000 tonnes.

### There appears to be a bifurcation in cargo ship size -- a trend towards many small cargo ships and relatively fewer very very big ones.

```{r}

df %>% 
  filter(launched > 1970) %>% 
  mutate(decade = launched - launched %% 10) %>% 
  mutate(decade = factor(decade)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tonnage, y = decade, fill = stat(x))) +
    geom_density_ridges_gradient(scale = 3, 
                                 rel_min_height = 0.01, 
                                 gradient_lwd = 1.) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::number_format()) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = "Deadweight tonnage", option = "D",
                       labels = scales::number_format()) +
  labs(y = "Decade") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.key.width = unit(2.5, "cm")) +
  guides(fill = guide_colourbar(title.position = "bottom"))

```

Interestingly, it looks like there is a growing bifurcation in the distribution. In other words, though the maximum size is increasing, there is a growing gap between the many smaller ships at the bottom of the distribution and the few large ones at the top. Wow! Look at those economies of scale kicking in!

### How does the Ever Given compare to other large vessels?

```{r}
df_plot <- df %>% 
  filter(!is.na(type)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(length, beam, draft), names_to = "feature", values_to = "value") %>% 
  mutate(feature = str_to_title(feature)) %>% 
  mutate(feature = factor(feature, levels = c("Length", "Draft", "Beam"))) %>% 
  mutate(flag_eg = ifelse(name == "Ever Given", 1, 0))

renderPlotly({
    
  h <- df_plot %>%   
    filter(feature %in% input$facet_big) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(value, tonnage, colour = type, group = 1)) +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F, colour = "grey50") +
    geom_point() +
    geom_point(data = df_plot %>% filter(flag_eg == 1,
                                         feature %in% input$facet_big), 
               aes(shape = name), 
               cex = 10,
               show.legend = T) +
    geom_text(data = df_plot %>% filter(flag_eg == 1,
                                        feature %in% input$facet_big),
              aes(label = name), show.legend = F, colour = "grey25", size = 3) +
    scale_shape_manual(values = 18) +
    scale_x_continuous(guide = guide_axis(check.overlap = T)) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::number_format()) +
    facet_wrap(~ feature, scales = "free_x") +
    labs(x = "Value (m)",
         y = "Gross tonnage",
         colour = "Type",
         shape = "Highlight")
  
  ggplotly(h)
  
})
  
```

***
We have seen that the Ever Given is a big container ship, but what about other types of ships? Cruise liners are pretty big, despite not being as long, have more space enclosed within the ship, known as gross tonnage. Gross tonnage, as opposed to deadweight tonnage, measures volume rather than mass.

It is interesting to see that the container ships all have relatively low drafts compared to the supertankers. Cruise ships have the smallest drafts, given that the must navigate into many different harbours around the world, some of which are not suited to larger ships such as super tankers.

**Select the metric(s) you want to compare:**

```{r}

selectizeInput("facet_big", label = "Chosen comparison metric(s):",
            choices = unique(df_plot$feature), 
            selected = "Draft",
            multiple = T)

```
