### Planning

I want to make a flexdashboard that tells a story. 

I want to ask the question, "How big is the Ever Given"?

I want to have a sectio on the history of cargo ships, and show how big they have become.

Then I want to compare the Ever Given to other container ships.

Then I want to compare it to other large ships.

I want to learn about the storyboard function.

I also want to have a tab that compares the Ever Given to other big things, like a Supertrumps comparison.
