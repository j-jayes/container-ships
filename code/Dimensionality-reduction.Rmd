```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = F, message = F, warning = F)
```

### Purpose

Practice dimensionality reduction with the ship data.

I want this as a resource I can look back at to follow the same steps again.

### Reading in data

```{r}
df <- read_rds("data/vessel_finder_data_detailed_55k.rds")

```

### Dimensionality reduction

```{r}
df %>% 
  

```
