```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = F, message = F, warning = F)


library(pacman)
p_load(tidyverse, rvest, glue)

```

### Purpose

I want to scrape information about cargo and container ships from wikipedia and make a shiny app out of it so that people can see how big ships have become.

```{r}

url <- "https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels?page=1&type=401"

html <- read_html(url)

table <- html %>% 
  html_nodes(".results") %>% 
  html_table()

table <- table[[1]]

page <- table %>% 
  as_tibble(.name_repair = "unique") %>% 
  select(-Vessel...1) %>% 
  mutate(Vessel...2 = str_squish(Vessel...2)) %>% 
  rename(name = Vessel...2) %>% 
  mutate(name = str_remove_all(name, " Container Ship"),
         name = str_to_title(name))

```
